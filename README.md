# Twitter Archive Master Dataset.

The project is about wrangling, cleaning and visualizing **_WeRateDogs_** twitter account data from three different sources.
* From a CSV file.
* From the Twitters API.
* From a link provided [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv)

The first step is sourcing the data and cleaning by merging it into one single dataframe known as df and creating some simple visualizations.
